# Roulette
This utility is thought as a solution to when our teams need to alternate responsable person for diferent ceremonies.

# Motive
In our day-to-day, my Squad goes several ceremonies which need a responsable/moderator.

Actually, we use a Roulete (www.google.com). In this site, you can put a list of persons (member of team) and you can cross out these (por example, you can cross out the persons that have already left)
This site use a cookies by save the list of persons that you created. Thanks to this, you can use this site week by week.

But this have any problems:
- If you want have more than 1 rulette, you need that other person creates a new rulette. For example: you need one roulette for Dailys, other by Refinments...
- If the creator (person what have a cookies) is on vacation, sick, in another meeting... you can not use the roulette!

# Solution
I propose a web app which every Squad can put entry your members and generate differents roulettes. This roulettes will be stored into a database, file... I i can assure you that it will not depend on anyone's cookies.
